# AI-Powered Scrabble Companion Project

## 🎲 The Story Behind
As a tech enthusiast and board game lover, I've always been fascinated by how AI can enhance traditional games without replacing their core appeal. This project started during family game nights, where I noticed how digital tools could complement our physical Scrabble matches rather than replace them.

## 🎯 What I'm Building
This project consists of two complementary applications:

### 🎮 Moderator App (Game Master's View)
Think of it as a smart assistant for the game moderator. Using AI-powered image recognition, it captures moves, validates plays, and keeps score - all while letting players focus on the physical game.

### 📱 Companion App (Player's View)
A sleek digital window into the game state, allowing players to check scores, review moves, and get AI-powered insights about gameplay - without interrupting the flow of the physical game.

## 🤖 My AI Exploration Journey
This project is part of my journey exploring practical applications of AI, specifically:
- Using Gemini for image recognition and game state analysis
- Implementing natural language processing for move explanations
- Experimenting with voice synthesis for game commentary

## 🛠️ Current Development Status
- The Companion App is taking shape with a modern, iPad-optimized interface
- The Moderator App's AI-powered board recognition is under active development
- Real-time synchronization between apps is being implemented

## 📝 Testing & Development Notes
During development, I've found [ScrabbleCam](https://scrabblecam.com/) incredibly useful for testing the board recognition features. It provides a reliable way to simulate board captures during development.

## 🌟 Future Vision
I'm excited about adding features like:
- AI-powered move analysis and learning opportunities
- Voice commentary for a more immersive experience
- Detailed game statistics and insights
- Support for multiple languages (especially French)

## 📱 Platform Focus
- Moderator App: Optimized for mobile phones
- Companion App: Primary focus on iPad, with other tablets planned

## 🤝 Sharing & Feedback
While this is a personal project born from family game nights, I'm sharing it to:
- Document my journey in AI application development
- Share insights with others interested in similar projects
- Gather feedback from the community
