## Request : Analyze the project and provide an overview.

**Project Description:**

Comet is an AI-powered tool that enhances file exploration by providing insights and recommendations. It integrates with AI models to offer features such as file organization recommendations, large file identification, and more.

**Key Features:**

- Tree-like file system exploration
- File and folder filtering
- AI-powered insights
- Display file sizes and modification dates
- Integration with AI models (e.g., Gemini)

**Project Structure:**

The project is organized into the following modules:

- **features/explore**: Contains the ExploreService and ExploreCommand for file system exploration.
- **features/insights**: Includes the InsightsService, InsightsCommand, and AI agents for generating insights.
- **lib**: Core project files, including models, exceptions, and output formatting.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Programming languages and frameworks**: Dart
- **Architectural patterns**: Command-line interface (CLI)
- **Notable libraries**: ansicolor (for colored output), args (for command parsing), google_generative_ai (for AI integration)
- **Data handling**: Uses the file system for file exploration and reads project files for insights.

**Getting Started:**

To use Comet:

1. Install Dart and the Comet package (`pub global activate comet`).
2. Run `comet` in the terminal.
3. Use flags to specify exploration options (e.g., `--directories` to list only directories).

**Additional Information:**

- The project includes a full implementation, which is provided in the attached files.
