# gde-ideations

Welcome to my `gde-ideations` repository, a creative incubator where innovation meets implementation. As a Google Developer Expert, I am dedicated to exploring new ideas, experimenting with cutting-edge technologies, and developing projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.

This repository showcases a collection of projects, ranging from simple proof-of-concepts to fully-fledged applications, each representing a unique ideation born out of curiosity and a desire to solve real-world problems. Whether it's enhancing developer productivity, simplifying complex tasks, or creating apps that bring joy to users, every project is crafted with care and a commitment to quality.

## Current Ideas

- **Comet**: An AI-powered folder explorer that enhances the developer experience by providing intelligent insights into code organization and quality. [Explore Comet](/01_comet)

- **Oloodi Scrabble**: An AI-powered Scrabble companion project that enhances the traditional Scrabble experience through modern technology. The project consists of two complementary applications:
  - **Moderator App**: A smart assistant for the game moderator, using AI-powered image recognition to capture moves, validate plays, and keep score.
  - **Companion App**: A digital window into the game state, allowing players to check scores, review moves, and get AI-powered insights about gameplay.
